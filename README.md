# Hawaii Climate Analysis 
Planning a trip to Hawaii? Better check the weather!

# Project Goals
Using Python and SQLAlchemy conduct a basic climate analysis and data exploration of Hawaii climate. Use Matplotlib to plot significance of variables used in the analysis. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data. Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column. Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.

# Station Analysis
Design a query to calculate the total number of stations. Design a query to find the most active stations. Plot the results as a histogram with bins.

# Climate App (Part 2)
Design a Flask API based on the queries previously developed. Use FLASK to create routes. Return JSON representation of the data. List of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range. Use Flask jsonify to convert API data into a valid JSON response object.
